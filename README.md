Cloning kymco website by grunt template

This website is not complete detail elements but its vital pages were cloned. This project will be an useful example of using my [**grunt_template**](https://github.com/huubinh49/grunt_project)

In this project I follow BEM naming convention and some rules of cutting PSD files.
